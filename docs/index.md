## Community Edition

First in its class [Ixia-c Community Edition](quick-start/introduction.md) of the Elastic Network Generator with **BGP emulation and full set traffic capabilities** [limited by scale and performance](licensing.md) is available to anyone without registration and at no cost.

## OTG Examples

Explore [otg-examples](https://otg.dev/examples/otg-examples/) library to get hands-on experience with using Open Traffic Generator and Ixia-c. With a minimum Linux host or VM you can be running your first network data and control plane validation scenarios in minutes.

## Key Features

* Software multi-container application:
    * runs on Linux x86 compute,
    * includes software traffic generation and protocol emulation capabilities,
    * built using DPDK to generate high traffic rates on a single CPU core,
    * can control Keysight network test hardware.
* Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines like GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins.
* Supports test frameworks like Pytest or Golang test.
* Emulates key data center protocols with high scale of sessions and routes:
    * capable of leveraging 3rd party libraries to add unsupported packet formats,
    * provides patterns to modify common packet header fields to generate millions of unique packets.
* Supports:
    * configurable frame sizes,
    * rate specification in pps (packets per second) or % line-rate,
    * ability to send traffic bursts.
* Statistics:
    * per port and per flow,
    * tracks flows based on common packet header fields,
    * one way latency measurements (min, max, average) on a per flow basis,
    * capture packets and write to PCAP or analyze in the test logic.
