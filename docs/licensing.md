## KENG License Server
## Deploying the Keysight license server on KVM
KVM Resource requirements:
  
  * 2 CPU Cores
  * 4 GB of RAM
  * Minimum 10GB of storage
  * 1 available physical bridged adapter on KVM for management connectivity

### To deploy Keysight license server from qcow2 image:
1. Download deployment script `ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh` to install license server VM.
    ```sh
    # Download script
    curl -o ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh https://<location>/ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh
    # Change permission
    chmod u+x ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh
    # Usage of parameter options
    ./ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh -h
    # Install License server VM (default)
    ./ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh 
    # Install License server VM with parameters
    ./ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh (VM Name) (IP Address) (Netmask) (Gateway) (DNS Server) (SSH Public Key File) (Bridge) 
    ```
    Installation parameters:

    | Parameters          |Description  | 
    |---------------------|--------------|
    | VM Name             | Name of this VM will be assigned     | 
    | IP Address          | IP Address assigned to this VM. Must be a valid IP address \(Ex: 1.2.3.4\) or "DHCP"     | 
    | Netmask             | Netmask used by the VM, in "IP Address" format \(Ex: 1.2.3.4\) or "DHCP"     | 
    | Gateway             | Gateway IP Address for this VM, or "DHCP"     | 
    | DNS Server          | The DNS Server used for this VM, can be "DHCP"      | 
    | SSH Public Key File | The path to an SSH Key file that the "license_cli" user will use to access this VM. Use the string "AUTO" and we will call 'ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa -P' and use the resulting file "id_rsa.pub" as the input to the generated VM. |
    | Bridge              | "AUTO" or any named bridge.  If "AUTO", use the default bridge of "virbr0", which is the standard default bridge name. If anything else, the name provided will be used \(Ex: br0\).  This is the bridge that the VM network interface will use.  |

2. Start license server service in the VM
    ```sh
    # ssh to license cli using SSH key
    ssh -i id_rsa license_cli@<license_server_ip_address>
    # To check all available Keysight License Server shell commands
    help
    # Start license server service
    start license-server
    ```
    Available Keysight License Server shell commands:

### Install/uninstall licenses in license server VM
1. Get activation code from Keysight support.
2. SSH to license cli using SSH Key:
    ```sh
    ssh -i id_rsa license_cli@<license_server_ip_address>
    ```
3. Activate license using activation code:
    ```sh
    activate-license XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX 1
    ```
