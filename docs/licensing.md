 \* **Ixia-c Traffic Port Capacity** is determined as a sum of configured Ixia-c test port speeds with possible values: 100GE, 50GE, 40GE, 25GE, 10GE, 1GE. Maximum data plane performance of an Ixia-c port may be less than the configured port speed, depending on capabilities of the underlying hardware and software drivers.

 \*\* **Test seat concurrency** applies to a number of controller instances running with a configuration that exceeds the capabilities of the Community Edition.

 \*\*\* **Restricted** protocol scale supports maximum 4 BGP sessions per test. Capabilities of the **Limited** protocol scale depend on the protocol. Please contact [Keysight Support](https://support.ixiacom.com/contact/support) for details.

 Keysight Elastic Network Generator can simultaneously consume multiple licenses to increase the capabilities of a test. For example, if the Ixia-c Traffic Port Capacity configured in one test is 100GE, two Developer licenses will be consumed if available.

 If you require capabilities beyond those provided by the Community Edition, use [Keysight Elastic Network Generator](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/network-test/protocol-load-test/keysight-elastic-network-generator.html) product page to request an evaluation or a quote.

## License Server

Keysight uses a license server to manage floating or network shared licenses for its software products. The license server enables licenses to float and not be tied to a specific Elastic Network Generator instance. The Elastic Network Generator controllers MUST be able to reach the License server.

## Requirements

### Network connectivity

1. Internet access from the Keysight License server VM over HTTPS to the Keysight Software Manager (KSM) service [https://ksm.software.keysight.com/](https://ksm.software.keysight.com/) is desirable for online license activation, but not required. Alternative offline activation method is available and only requires a license administrator to have access to KSM.
2. Access from a license administrator's computer over SSH (TCP/22) for license operations (activation, deactivation, reservation, sync).
3. Access from any Keysight Elastic Network Generator `ixia-c-controller` container that needs a license during a test run over gRPC (TCP/7443) for license checkout and check-in.

The diagram below illustrates how different components communicate with the License server:

![License Server Connectivity](./res/license-server.drawio.svg)

### System requirements – KVM

The License server VM resource requirements when running on KVM hypervisor:

* 2 CPU cores
* 4 GB of RAM
* Minimum 10GB of storage
* 1 available physical bridged adapter on KVM for management connectivity

## Deployment

### KVM

1. Download the following license server VM deployment script:

 	 `license_server_kvm.sh`

	and use the following commands to run the script and deploy the VM:

    ```sh
    # Download script
    curl -o license_server_kvm.sh https://<location>/ixia_c_license_server_kvm_release.sh

    # Change permission
    chmod u+x license_server_kvm.sh

    # Usage of parameter options
    ./license_server_kvm.sh -h

    # Install License server VM (default)
    ./license_server_kvm.sh

    # Install License server VM with parameters
    ./license_server_kvm.sh \
        vm_name \
        ip_address netmask gateway dns_server \
        ssh_public_key_file \
        bridge
    ```

    Installation parameters:

    | Parameters            |Description  |
    |-----------------------|--------------|
    | `vm_name`             | Name assigned to the VM   |
    | `ip_address`          | IP address assigned to the VM. Can be either a static IP address \(such as: 1.2.3.4\) or "DHCP"     |
    | `netmask`             | Netmask used by the VM, in dotted-decimal format \(such as: 1.2.3.4\) or "DHCP"     |
    | `gateway`             | Gateway IP address for this VM. Can be either a static IP address \(such as: 1.2.3.4\) or "DHCP"     |
    | `dns_server`          | The DNS Server used for this VM, can be "DHCP" or a static IP address \(such as: 8.8.8.8\)      |
    | `ssh_public_key_file` | The path to an SSH Key file that the "license_cli" user will use to access this VM. If you enter the string "AUTO", the installtion script will call 'ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa -P' and use the resulting file "id_rsa.pub" as the input to the generated VM. |
    | `bridge`              | Bridge that the VM network interface will use. Can be "AUTO" or any named bridge.  If set to"AUTO", the default bridge "virbr0" will be used. If set to anything else, the named bridge will be used \(such as: br0\).   |

2. Start the license server service in the VM:

    ```sh
    # ssh to license cli using SSH key
    ssh -i id_rsa license_cli@<license_server_ip_address>

    # To check all available Keysight License Server shell commands
    help

    # Start license server service
    start license-server
    ```

## License administration

1. Obtain an activation code from your Keysight Sales Representative or [Keysight Support](https://support.ixiacom.com/contact/support).
2. On the license server VM, SSH to license cli using the SSH key:
    ```sh
    ssh -i id_rsa license_cli@<license_server_ip_address>
    ```
3. Activate the license using activation code:
    ```sh
    activate-license XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX 1
    ```
4. To uninstall (deactivate) a license:
    ```sh
    deactivate-license XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX 1
    ```

The following commands are available in the Keysight License server shell:
