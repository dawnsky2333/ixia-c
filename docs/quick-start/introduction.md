# What is ixia-c

Ixia-c is a modern, powerful, and API-driven traffic generator designed to cater to the needs of hyperscalers, network hardware vendors, and hobbyists alike.

It is distributed and deployed as a multi-container application that consists of a [controller](https://github.com/orgs/open-traffic-generator/packages/container/package/ixia-c-controller), a [traffic-engine](https://github.com/orgs/open-traffic-generator/packages/container/package/ixia-c-traffic-engine), and an [app-usage-reporter](https://github.com/orgs/open-traffic-generator/packages/container/package/ixia-c-app-usage-reporter).

As a reference implementation of [Open Traffic Generator API](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models), Ixia-c supports client SDKs in various languages, most prevalent being [snappi](https://pypi.org/project/snappi/) (Python SDK).

> [Keysight](https://www.keysight.com) also offers a well supported commercial version, [Keysight Elastic Network Generator](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/network-test/protocol-load-test/keysight-elastic-network-generator.html), with no restrictions on **performance and scalability**. Scripts written for the free version are **compatible** with this version.

## Quick Start

Before you proceed, ensure that the [system prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) are met.

* Deploy Ixia-c

  ```bash
  # start ixia-c controller
  docker run -d --network=host ghcr.io/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c-controller --accept-eula
  docker run --net=host -d ghcr.io/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c-app-usage-reporter

  # start ixia-c traffic engine on eth1 interface
  docker run -d --network=host --privileged     \
    -e ARG_IFACE_LIST="virtual@af_packet,eth1"  \
    -e OPT_NO_HUGEPAGES="Yes"                   \
    ghcr.io/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c-traffic-engine
  ```

  > Once the containers are up, accessing https://controller-ip/docs/ will open up an interactive REST API documentation. For more information, see [deployment guide](../deployments.md).

* Generate Traffic using [snappi](https://pypi.org/project/snappi/). For more details on snappi, see [hello-snappi](../developer/hello-snappi.md).

  ```bash
  # clone repo for test suites, useful helper scripts, deployment files, etc.
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c && cd ixia-c

  # install snappi
  python -m pip install --upgrade snappi==0.9.4
  # run a standalone script to generate TCP traffic and fetch metrics
  python snappi-tests/scripts/quickstart_snappi.py
  ```

  > After a successful run, the port metrics will be printed on the console.

??? abstract "Expand this section for an overview of the script you just ran"

    ```python
    import snappi
    # create a new API instance over HTTPS transport where location points to controller
    api = snappi.api(location="https://localhost", verify=False)
    # OR
    # create a new API instance over gRPC transport where location points to controller
    api = snappi.api(location="localhost:40051", transport=snappi.Transport.GRPC)

    # create a config object to be pushed to controller
    config = api.config()
    # add a port with location pointing to traffic engine
    prt = config.ports.port(name='prt', location='localhost:5555')[-1]
    # add a flow and assign endpoints
    flw = config.flows.flow(name='flw')[-1]
    flw.tx_rx.port.tx_name = prt.name

    # configure 100 packets to be sent, each having a size of 128 bytes
    flw.size.fixed = 128
    flw.duration.fixed_packets.packets = 100

    # add Ethernet, IP and TCP protocol headers with defaults
    flw.packet.ethernet().ipv4().tcp()

    # push configuration
    api.set_config(config)

    # start transmitting configured flows
    ts = api.transmit_state()
    ts.state = ts.START
    api.set_transmit_state(ts)

    # fetch & print port metrics
    req = api.metrics_request()
    req.port.port_names = [prt.name]
    print(api.get_metrics(req))
    ```

* Optionally, you can generate the traffic by using [curl](https://curl.se/).

  >You can also pass an equivalent **JSON configuration** directly to the ixia-c controller by using **curl** and without installing snappi.
  >For the detailed description of each node (and their attributes) in the JSON configuration, see [Open Traffic Generator API](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-traffic-generator/models/v0.9.1/artifacts/openapi.yaml).

  ```bash
  # push the contents of config file snappi-tests/configs/quickstart_snappi.json
  curl -k https://localhost/config -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @snappi-tests/configs/quickstart_snappi.json
  # start transmitting configured flows
  curl -k https://localhost/control/transmit -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "start"}'
  # fetch all port metrics
  curl -k https://localhost/results/metrics -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"choice": "port"}}'
  ```
