### Bug Fixes

* The flow configuration parameter `inter_burst_gap` when specified in nanoseconds can now be set to a value larger than 4.2 seconds.
* Invalid values can now be set for the `phb` (per hob behavior) field in the DSCP bits in the IPv4 header.
* The `set_config` method will return an error when flows are over subscribed.
* Fixed an error in calculation for packet counts when `duration` is set in terms of fixed_seconds.

### Known Issues

* The metrics `frames_rx_rate` and `bytes_rx_rate` in port statistics are not calculated correctly and are always zero.
* The metric `min_latency_ns` in flow statistics is not calculated correctly and is always zero.
