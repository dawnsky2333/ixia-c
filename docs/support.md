# Support

Commercial customers of the Keysight Elastic Network Generator can obtain support through the [Keysight Support Center](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/support.html), using the link to Network Test (Layer 2/3) and Visibility Support (Ixia). Please be ready to provide the KENG License activation code and a clear problem description.

Support for the free version of Ixia-c can be obtained over Slack. You can join the Slack workspace ixia-c.slack.com using [this invite](https://join.slack.com/t/ixia-c/shared_invite/zt-1inkw2zr4-Jd6uynnxxhvhV6WC0MCtLQ). We also encourage you to open issues & enhancements in the [Ixia-c](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c/issues) repository.
