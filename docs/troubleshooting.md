# Troubleshooting

This section explains the troubleshooting scenarios for different environments.

## OTG hardware environment

**<ins>The test fails while it is configuring OTG ports</ins>**: This situation may arise due to various reasons. For example, the port ownership is not cleared by the previous test properly, or the OTG port went to a bad state, and etc. The course of action in such scenarios can be as follows:

* Manually clear the ownership of the port.
* Reboot the chassis ports.
* Restsart the docker containers.
* Use `docker compose` or `docker-compose` to turn the containers down and up.
* Execute the following commands from the directory where you have kept your docker-compose.yaml file.

```sh
docker-compose down
```

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

**<ins>Configuration is failing port-speed mismatch</ins>**: In this scenario, the OTG port configuration will also fail due to the speed mismatch between the DUT port and chassis port.
To execute the test, do the following:

* Adjust your DUT port speed to the default port speed of the chassis port.
* Reboot the chassis ports.
* Execute your test.
