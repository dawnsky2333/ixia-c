# Troubleshooting 
Troubleshooting info for different environment.
### OTG hardware environment
**<ins>The test fails while it is configuring OTG ports</ins>** - This situation may arise due to various reasons such as, port ownership is not cleared by previous test properly, or OTG port went to a bad state, etc. In such scenarios course of action could be
  * Manually clear the ownership of the port.
  * Then reboot the chassis ports.
  * Restsart your docker containres.
  * Use 'docker compose' or docker-compose to turn the containers down and up. Execute the below commands from the directory where you have kept your docker-compose.yaml file.
```
docker-compose down
```
```
docker-compose up -d
```
**<ins>Configuration is failing port-speed mismatch</ins>** - In this case OTG port configuration will also fail due to speed mismatch between DUT port and chassis port. In this scenario you can adjust your DUTâ€™s port speed to the default port speed of the chassis port, reboot the chassis ports and then execute your test.
